# Clean Architecture with Hexagonal Architecture Approach

This project focuses on implementing Clean Architecture with a Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) approach, emphasizing good software development practices. It encompasses architecture, design, and code principles to build scalable, maintainable, and high-quality software systems.

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Organize your software into distinct layers, separating concerns and making your system independent of frameworks and databases.
  
- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):** Embrace the hexagonal architecture pattern to achieve better decoupling and testability, where the core business logic is isolated from external concerns such as databases and user interfaces.

- **Software Development Best Practices:** Follow industry-standard best practices for software development, including SOLID principles, design patterns, and clean code practices.
